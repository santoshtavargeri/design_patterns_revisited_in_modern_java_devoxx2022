/*
  Strategy pattern
    we want to vary a small part of an algorithm while
    keeping the rest of the algorithm the same.

  Language design is program design


  Design patterns often kick in to fill the gaps of 
  a programming languge.

  A more power a language is, the less we talk about
  design patterns as these naturally become the features
  of the language.

  In the past, how did we use strategy

  We created an interface and then a bunch of classes
  Then wire them together often use factories.

  Lambdas are lightweight strategies
